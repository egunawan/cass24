#### content.

Combinatorics is related to the word "combinations", and much of the field deals with counting problems ("enumeration"). More broadly, combinatorics considers discrete structures, such as graphs, (as opposed to the continuous structures considered in calculus and analysis) and questions that go beyond simply counting the number of possibilities. With the advent of computers in the second half of the last century, such questions have become increasingly important in applications as well as more managable to solve. Specifically, we plan to go through some of the following topics from the text, depending on student interest:
+ Pigeon-Hole Principle;
+ Permutations & Combinations, bijections;
+ Binomial Theorem and combinatorial proofs;
+ Ordinary Generating functions;
+ Exponential Generating Functions
+ Graph Theory;
+ Trees;
+ Partitions and related combinatorial objects;
+ Sieve methods (Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion);
+ Partially-ordered sets ("Posets");
+ Probability;
+ Combinatorial Algorithms;
+ Computational Complexity

#### presentations and group work.

Presentations and group work of one form or another will take place every day (with lecturing in between).

* To get full presentation credit, each student needs to present at least once every 2 weeks. I encourage you to present in a group of two or three. We will be generous and respectful of your work. You will not be penalized for mistakes, but you won't earn credit if you have not attempted the problems before class. The presentation problems will come from homework problems, which will be announced ahead of time.

* To receive full audience participation credit, you need to be physically and mentally present while other students are speaking (at least 75% of all class days). To earn audience participation credit for a particular day, all phones and other technology and distractions should be put away during presentations. The presenters should have your full attention, and you are responsible for asking questions when you don't understand or disagree with the presenters. Friendly comments and compliments are also encouraged.

<!--
#### study groups.
If you can not find a study group, e-mail me so that I can help you get involved. I assume that you will be working in groups when I make up the assignments. 
-->

#### {{site.data.assessment.hws}}.  
I ask that you work on the rough drafts with others on these {{site.data.assessment.hws}}, so that you can practice doing math collaboratively. Afterwards, you must do the write up on your own. If you are unsure  about your solutions (and even if you are), you are encouraged to meet with me to go over your work before you submit it. 
All {{site.data.assessment.hws}} should be typed in LaTeX and the source code should be stored in your Overleaf project (more details on this later). Please sign up for an [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) account on [https://www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com) and let me know the email address you used to sign up.


<!--
#### {{site.data.assessment.midterms}} and final.

There will be two {{site.data.assessment.midterms}} (will be announced on [schedule](schedule.html)) and a final. 
Please speak to me soon if you will have a conflict or would need accomodation such as private space, extra time, etc (via [Accessibility Services for Students](http://accessibility.uconn.edu/students/)).
-->

#### grading policy. 
Grades will be determined as follows:

| quizzes, group work, presentations and audience participation:   | 10%|
| homework: | 30%|  <!-- -->
| exams: | 60% | <!-- 30,20,20 or 40,30 --> 

<br>
Late work will not be accepted, but your lowest homework grade will be dropped.

<!--
<br>
* Grade cutoffs are at most 90%, 80%, 70%, and 60% for A-, B-, C-, and D-.
* Your grade does not depend on other students' grades. 

#### midterm grade report. 
I will submit a (temporary) midterm grade report by the end of week 6 for grades lower than B-. For simplicity, I will not include +/-.

-->

#### grading questions.
Please let me know ASAP (but within one week) if I've made mistakes in grading your assessments. 
<!--This should be done during drop-in office hours or by-appointment office hours (as opposed to in class).-->

#### Blackboard HuskyCT.
All announcements will be made on this course website. However, I will periodically upload your grades on HuskyCT [lms.uconn.edu](https://lms.uconn.edu "Blackboard HuskyCT"). 
<!--If you do not have a NetID and password set up yet, please visit [netid.uconn.edu](https://netid.uconn.edu "UConn NetID") to set yours up. -->


[//]: ### problem presentations (not graded).
[//]: Each team will be invited to present problems on the board this semester. Partial solutions are fine! I will roll a dice or you may volunteer. I will moderate the discussions and assists with communication of the ideas. 



#### class etiquette.
Please talk to me if you need access to technology during class. Otherwise, I expect you to turn off your phones, tablets, computers, etc. during class since these can be distracting.

---------

#### office hours.

All office hours are now conducted via Webex, by appointments (via email)

<!--
You can show up to *drop-in hours* without appointments. Additionally, I am happy to make an appointment with you at a different time. 
-->


#### mental wellbeing.
Strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol or drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating, or lack of motivation may affect a student's academic performance or reduce a student's ability to participate in daily activities. If you or someone you know expresses such health concerns or experiences a stressful event that can create barriers to learning, UConn services are available to assist you. Learn about confidential health services available on campus at [counseling.uconn.edu](http://counseling.uconn.edu "UConn Counseling") Arjona Building, 4th floor, near Mirror Lake phone 860-486-4705. See also [dos.uconn.edu/student-resources/](http://dos.uconn.edu/student-resources/ "Dean of Students Office Student Resources").

If you see this sentence, please email me a fun picture of huskies.


#### accommodation services.
The Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) wants to ensure students with disabilities have the same access to programs, opportunities and activities as all others at UConn. 
If you think you have short-term or long-term disability, consider going to Accessibility Services for Students [accessibility.uconn.edu/students/](http://accessibility.uconn.edu/students/) or contacting CSD at 860-486-2020 or [csd@uconn.edu](mailto:csd@uconn.edu) 
for general information or to request a (confidential) student accommodation.
You can give me a letter from the CSD at any time during the course of the semester in order to receive accommodations. 

Also know that psychological problems are a disability in that they create a barrier to completing your work. A lot of people seek out mental health services for the first time in college. Please don’t neglect depression or stress. Get help! If at any point you feel depressed or stressed to the point that your academic work suffers, please take advantage of free counseling on campus through Counseling Services: [counseling.uconn.edu](http://counseling.uconn.edu "UConn Counseling") Arjona Building, 4th floor, near Mirror Lake phone 860-486-4705.

#### student conduct code.
UConns Student Conduct Code [community.uconn.edu/the-student-code](http://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code) includes both academic integrity and compliance with the policy against discrimination, harassment, and  interpersonal violence.

#### academic integrity.
It is in everyone's best interest to maintain their academic integrity. 
Any form of academic dishonesty undermines the goals of our course and devalues the learning process. 
Academic dishonesty is a serious offense at UConn and will result in an academic misconduct report and a zero score (for the first incident) and a failure in {{site.data.course.number}} (for the second incident).
For more information, consult UConns guidelines for academic integrity: [community.uconn.edu/the-student-code-appendix-a](http://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code-appendix-a). 
* For tips to minimize academic misconduct, 
see [Protecting yourself from being charged with academic dishonesty](http://community.uconn.edu/proactive-%20strategies-for-students-to-minimize-academic-misconduct/).
* Even though you are encouraged to work together on homework, **letting someone else copy your homework solution is cheating**. Supplying help for an in-class exam is also cheating. Don't do it.

#### using peers and technology as resources.
Unless stated otherwise, in *this particular course (only this class - you should check with your professor for each class)*, you are free to work with other people and use technology on take-home assigments to aid your learning. 
Whenever you work with another person or get help from a different book or the internet on a take-home assignment, please credit them - write the person's name, website address at the top of your submission. 

Working with other people on mathematics is highly encouraged and fun. You may work with anyone on your take-home problems. but make sure to **write up  your final draft by yourself**.

#### policy statements.
Please refer to <a href="http://provost.uconn.edu/syllabi-references/">http://provost.uconn.edu/syllabi-references/</a> for the common policies we follow at UConn. See [the full policy statements](policy.html).
