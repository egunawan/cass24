### Week 6

Go to the talk [Legacy Speaker Event: Weapons of Math Destruction](http://events.uconn.edu/event/55723/2017-10-04) by 
[Cathy O'Neil](https://www.ted.com/speakers/cathy_o_neil)
on Wednesday, October 4 at 7:00pm â€“ 8:30pm at Laurel Hall 101.
See below for how to write your reflection essay. 

Note: because there will probably be a line of people wanting to speak with the speaker afterwards, you don't have to ask a question to the speaker afterwards. But go up to the front of the room and try to make a comment like 'thank you for the talk' or another compliment. 

### Week 4

Go to [Math club talk on probability integral](http://www.math.uconn.edu/research/seminars/show-poster/?TalkID=15331) on Wed, Sept 20 at 5:50pm in MONT 314. 

See a sample reflection essay here: [Gurman Singh: Partial Fraction Decomposition Math Club Talk](sample_essay.html).

### Reflection essay instruction

Ask a question during the talk (it could be as simple as, 'could you repeat your previous explanation?')
Submit a reflection on the talk (due within two weeks after the talk) in class.

* This should be a summary in your own words that includes a couple new facts you learned in the talk. 

* Your summary should include
a description of the main goals of the talk (if the talk is too confusing or you can't figure out the main goals of the talk, there is time for the audience to ask questions at the end or the middle of the talk).

* In your reflection, write down your question to the speaker and their response.

* Include also a brief personal comment about the topics discussed. 

* Please type roughly a 1-page submission (but no longer than 2 pages).

* To include pictures or mathematical symbols/equations, you can either type them directly (if possible), you can use an equation editor to type them, use LaTeX (see the templates given under the [Schedule](../schedule.html) page), or you can leave space in your printout and write the mathematical symbols/equations by hand. 

### Week 2

Go to [Math club talk on general partial fraction decomposition](http://www.math.uconn.edu/research/seminars/show-poster/?TalkID=15329&Rendition=0) on Wed, Sept 6 at 5:45 in MONT 314.
