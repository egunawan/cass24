Instructions for taking notes while reading the online textbook:
* Take notes while reading
* Read slowly and carefully - verify all the given examples on your own
* Write down vocab words and concepts that you've never seen before or have forgotten.
* If the words or concepts are explained in this textbook, write down the definitions/explanations. Otherwise, look up all these vocab words/concepts (on the internet or your old linear algebra/Calculus textbook or your textbook for Math 2710) and attempt to understand them. 
* Click on the 'proofs' to hide/show the proofs. Attempt to do some of the proofs on your own without looking, then compare with the textbook's proofs.


### Topics (covered in Math 2710 Transitions to Advanced Math) that are necessary for the Math Scholars course

* [1 Preliminaries](http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/sets.html)

These topics are especially important: 
[Sets and Equivalence Relations](http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/section-sets-and-equivalence-relations.html) and [Exercises](http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/exercises-sets.html)

* [2 The Integers](http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/integers.html)

These topics are especially important: 
[Mathematical Induction](http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/section-math-induction.html) and [Exercises](http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/exercises-integers.html). If you have time, do also [the division algorithm](http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/section-division-algorithm.html)

Note: There are many videos on these topics if you go on YouTube or Google. If you find videos that are especially useful (preferably without ads), please let me know and I will list them here.

Note: If you are done with the first two chapters, you can start reading these chapters (which will be covered in the Abstract Algebra I class): 3 Groups, 4 Cyclic Groups, 5 Permutation Groups, 6 Cosets and Lagrange's Theorem, 9 Isomorphisms, 10 Normal subgroups, 11 Group Homomorphisms, 12 Matrix Groups and Symmetry, 14 Group Actions. We will spend the first several weeks in Math Scholars learning the basics from these chapters.
