### Summary:


KEEP

* (everyone) group work/ working on HW in class in groups
* (4) partially filled handouts
* (2) Reading HW
* (2) Student presentations
* (1) group quiz
* (1) answer keys to check work
* (1) optional WebWork


STOP

* "Not stop but less lecturing using just the board + lecturing using handouts and more group work"

* "WebAssign problems because they aren't that helpful"

* "Not have mandatory snow day classes because sometimes it's nice to have a day off"


START

* "Start more applied problems relating to our majors (mostly engineering)"

* "Give more challenging problems so we have a better understanding of the material"

* "More problems in class, try and go a little slower with more challening materials (for example, alternating series remainder theorem)""

* "Maybe one review session before a test, although that is basically office hours"

* "Do more example problems in class"

* "Handing all collected work back in time to use it to study for quizzes/exams"


SELF-STUDY TIPS (from all sections)

* I do homework right after class
* Review recent reading HW
* For tests, I complete the entire review sheet. This has helped me be prepared for exams.
* The week of the test, go over everything meticulously, and the next day review hardest topics.
* Study groups, meeting with other students after class
* Watch Khan Academy vidoes
* practice problems
* flash cards
