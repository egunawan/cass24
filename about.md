Pending funding, the Cluster Algebras Spring School will take place at the University of Connecticut on Monday May 17 to Friday May 21, 2024.

The school is intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students with research interest in cluster algebras.

Students will attend four short courses on recent developments in the area. Each course is divided into 5 lectures which are scheduled for the mornings and early afternoons. In the late afternoons and evenings, students will work in groups on problem sets from these courses.
