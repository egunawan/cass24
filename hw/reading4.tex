%Write down everyone who helped you, including classmates who contributed to your thought process. Write down Bona's textbook and other written sources you used as well.

\subsection*{Instruction}
Please submit all questions. Both handwritten or typed solutions are accepted.

You are encouraged to discuss the problems with other people in or outside of class. You are also welcome to come see me to show me what you've done so far.

You would need the second chapter of  B\'ona's ``A Walk Through Combinatorics" textbook (4th, 3rd, or 2nd Ed.)

\section{Optional: Sec 2.1 Quick Check}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	Let $a_0=1$ and let $a_{n+1}=4a_n+1$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. 
	Prove \emph{using induction} that for all nonnegative integers $n$, the equality 
	\[
	a_n = \frac{4^{n+1}-1}{3}
	\]
	holds.
	
	\item 
	\emph{Use induction} to prove that if $a_n=1+2+\dots+n$, then 
	\[
	a_n = n(n+1)
	/2
	\]
	for all positive integers $n$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sec 2.2 Strong Induction}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	Copy the algorithm of strong induction (from the first page of Sec 2.2 Strong Induction).
	
	\item Write down the explanation (from the book, pg 30) for why the method of induction is valid. Add a few extra phrases and sentences to the book's explanation.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Book Example}
Complete at least one of the following.


\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	Go to Example 2.5 and attempt to solve it on your own. Then use the book's solution to improve your answer.
	
	\item
	Go to Example 2.6 and attempt to solve it on your own. Then use the book's solution to improve your answer.	
\end{enumerate}






\section*{Attempt presentation problems (Don't submit)}\label{sec:presentation}
Attempt all presentation problems for week 2:\\
\href{https://egunawan.github.io/combinatorics/hw/wk2problems.pdf}{egunawan.github.io/combinatorics/hw/wk2problems.pdf}


%Some of the questions will be chosen to be presented during class this week. You may volunteer to present or be an audience member. 

Some of the questions will be picked for presentation problems and for future homework / exam questions. 



\section{Survey}
\begin{enumerate}[i.] 
\item Approximately how much time did you spend on this homework?
\item Write down the resources (for example, B\'ona's textbook or a  \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/}{math.stackexchange.com/} page) you referenced and the people that you talked with.	
\item Any questions about this homework?
\end{enumerate}
