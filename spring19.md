Instructions for taking notes while watching the linked videos by Federico Ardila. 
* You can play it up to 2x speed or at a slower pace. 
* Take as much or as little note as you need to follow the lectures.
* Lecture notes are also available on Ardila's [2008 course website](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/Clase/Coxeter/lectures.html). [List of lecture videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-XzhVrXIVeSVcV9iRJ4S9WAH1ryq4hTQ)

Instructions for taking notes while reading the assigned pages:
* Correct any typos you see 
* Read slowly and carefully - verify all the given examples on your own
* Write down vocab words and concepts that you've never seen before or have forgotten.
* If the words or concepts are explained in this textbook, write down the definitions/explanations. Otherwise, look up all these vocab words/concepts (on the internet or your algebra textbook) and attempt to understand them. 
* Bring the questions about these new concepts to the meeting

Instructions for exercises:
* Be ready to present to me
* You can use any sources (book, online, or people - please credit your sources)
* Hand-written is fine.

#### Reading Part 1

+ Take notes on Sec 2.1 and 2.2 (pg 17-20) of [FWZ textbook](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05735). Budget an hour or more for each of pages 18, 19, and 20.

+ Practice doing mutations (1 hour)
    + Do several sequences of mutations starting from the quiver 1->2->3 by hand and then using [Keller's Quiver mutation in JavaScript](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~bernhard.keller/quivermutation/)
    + Do several sequences of mutations starting from the quiver of shape D4 by hand and then using [Keller's Quiver mutation in JavaScript](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~bernhard.keller/quivermutation/)

+ Exercises from reading: Exercise 2.1.4 and Exercise 2.2.3.

#### Computing Part 1

* Play with [Keller's Quiver mutation in JavaScript](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~bernhard.keller/quivermutation/), either download or use it on the browser.
    + Try to compute the mutation class for the quiver 1 -> 2 -> 3 (type A3) both by hand and using Keller's app
    + Try to compute the mutation class for the quiver (with 4 vertices) 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 (type D4) both by hand and using Keller's app

* Download [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org) on your computer. If you have trouble installing it, for now get a free account on [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/)
