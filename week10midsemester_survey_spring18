To help me improve your learning this semester, please fill in your answers under KEEP, STOP, and START. I cannot change the standard Calc 2 materials, BUT I can make changes to class activities, and I will consider everyone's feedback. 

For example, some aspects of the class so far include: 
reading HW, lectures using partially filled handouts/slides (as opposed to lecturing on the board), lectures using just the board, student presentations, individual quiz, group quiz, working on homework in class in groups, assigning (optional) WebWork problems.

* Aspects to KEEP (for example, continue using partially filled handouts, continue making optional WebWork problems available online, continue group work during class). You can include your reasoning:





* Aspects to STOP (for example, stop using partially filled handouts, stop group work during class). You can include your reasoning:






* Aspects to START (for example, start assigning more applied problems and more challenging/interesting problems, start having out-of-class sessions designated for homework help or review sessions). You can include your reasoning:






* Optional: Please share any self-study tips from this semester (or the past) for Calculus 2, if any.



* Optional: Which topics are you most comfortable with? Which topics would you need more review on before the final exam?
