### Text and WebAssign: 
The textbook for the course is *Calculus: Early Transcendentals by James Stewart (8th Edition)*, which is bundled with a WebAssign code for online homework. There are three ways to purchase the text and the WebAssign access code:
￼
1. **BEST VALUE:** Get the text and WebAssign access code bundled together from the publisher’s special website for either the single variable version ($91.43 +tax with free shipping)
or the full version ($107.59 +tax with free shipping) at 
[http://www.cengagebrain.com/course/2344661](http://www.cengagebrain.com/course/2344661 "MATH 1131/1132/2110 - CALC I, II, & III")).
2. Buy/rent the text and WebAssign access code bundled together at the UConn Bookstore, slightly more expensive at $115.25+tax and $136.80+tax: [Uconn Bookstore](http://uconn.bncollege.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TBWizardView?catalogId=10001&langId=-1&storeId=88191).
3. NOT RECOMMENDED: Get the text separately from anywhere, and buy the
WebAssign access code when you access your homework through HuskyCT.
4. NOT RECOMMENDED: You can buy just the WebAssign code (and no paper textbook), but it is actually slightly more expensive than option 1.

* If you do NOT plan to take Math 2110 or Math 2130 (multivariable calculus), then you should purchase *Single-Variable Calculus*: Early Transcendentals by Stewart (8th Edition). 
* If you DO plan to take Math [2110](http://www.math.uconn.edu/courses/course-info/?Course=2110Q&Campus=STORR&Year=2017&Semester=Fall "Math 2110Q") or [2130](http://www.math.uconn.edu/courses/course-info/?Course=2130Q&Campus=STORR&Year=2017&Semester=Fall "Math 2130Q") then you can consider purchasing Calculus: Early Transcendentals by Stewart (8th Edition). But note that your future Multivariable Calculus instructor may choose to use a different textbook, and this full version is pretty heavy.

### Older edition of the textbook
It would be more convenient (for knowing exactly which pages to go to for your reading assignment, etc) if you have the 8th edition, but you should be just fine with a much cheaper (paper or electronic) 7th or 6th edition.

### WebAssign code
* Purchasing the text and WebAssign code together lets you use that access code for the life of the textbook edition. 
* The WebAssign code also gives you access to the e-book version of the textbook, which includes lecture videos and interactive visualizations.
* WebAssign Assignments will be assigned for each section covered in class. If you do not wish to purchase a WebAssign code, that's OK - you may do practice problems from the textbook instead.
* If you already have a textbook but doesn't have a WebAssign code, the best way to buy the code is through WebAssign - you get there through HuskyCT HuskyCT [lms.uconn.edu](https://lms.uconn.edu "Blackboard HuskyCT"). If you buy a used code, it will be connected to a course that is probably not compatible with our course.
