### Earning bonus point A (Week 14)

* Go to the Math Club Talk [Applications of Divergence of the Harmonic Series](http://www.math.uconn.edu/research/seminars/show-poster/?TalkID=15340) on Wednesday, November 29, 2017 at 5:45 pm in Monteith 314 (MONT 314).

* Ask a question to the speaker during or after the talk (it could be as simple as, 'could you repeat your previous explanation?') If the speaker leaves before you get to ask a question, save your question for me and ask during class. 

Note: If you like pizza, arrive early before all the pizza are gone.

Submit a reflection essay before the last day of classes, Dec 8. See a sample reflection essay here: [Reflection essay: Partial Fraction Decomposition Math Club Talk](sample_essay.html).

### Earning bonus point B (Week 14)

(You can earn this bonus point without attending the math club talk.)

* On Friday or Monday, give a short, informal presentation during class on applications of the harmonic series (other than building a long one-sided bridge). You can pick one or more applications which Dr. Conrad mentions during his talk. If you do not make it to his talk, you can ask a classmate for their notes. If too many students opt to present, some presentations will take place during office hours instead of during class.

### Reflection essay instruction

* This should be a summary in your own words that includes a couple new facts you learned in the talk. 

* Your summary should include
a description of the main goals of the talk (if the talk is too confusing or you can't figure out the main goals of the talk, there is time for the audience to ask questions at the end or the middle of the talk).

* In your reflection, write down your question to the speaker and their response.

* Include also a brief personal comment about the topics discussed. 

* Please type roughly a 1-page submission (but no longer than 2 pages).

* To include pictures or mathematical symbols/equations, you can either type them directly (if possible), you can use an equation editor to type them, use LaTeX (see the templates given under the [Schedule](../schedule.html) page), or you can leave space in your printout and write the mathematical symbols/equations by hand.
